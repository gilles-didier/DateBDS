Probabilities of tree topologies with temporal constraints and diversification shifts

Three software are provided

 - 'dist'
	compute the divergence time distributions of a phylogenetic tree under the birth-death-sampling model.
	
 - 'samp'
	sample the divergence times of a phylogenetic tree under the birth-death-sampling model.
	
 - 'shif'
	computes ROC plots for 4 tests of diversification shifts from Yule tree simulations
